This is my first post on the new site. Hopefully more content to come.

## Why This is Significant

Having my own website has always been something that I've wanted. Multiple times
I have created a landing that I thought represented me. Even now, having taken
heavy inspiration from another site, I'm not sure I can call this fully mine.

What matters is that the site is done, and, if even for just a moment, I am
satisfied.

## What's Next

I plan to keep this site updated with items that interest and reflect me.
